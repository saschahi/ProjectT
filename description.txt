Project-T is a public Twitch Library for all to use.

It handles a connection to Twitch and catches events such as Messages, Whispers, Bits, Subscriptions etc. and lets modders hook into these to create Fun Gameplay elements.

Possible examples:
- Spawn 1 Zombie/Slime/whatever for every bit someone sends through the chat
- Activate a random Teleportation effect for every new subscriber
- Activate a home Teleportation for every reocurring subscriber
- Let your Chat vote every X minutes on some fun events

The possibilities are endless.

Project-T itself does not bring these Features. Project-T brings:
- A stable connection to your Twitch-Chat
- An inbuilt Currency system for your Viewers to amass coins and for other mods to use
- Hooks for Events that other mods can listen to
- an easy way to send Messages to your Twitch chat for other mods
- Viewernames, IDs and Currencies are saved Locally and don't get lost if you close the game

This mod can be used in Multiplayer and Singleplayer.
